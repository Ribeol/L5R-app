            "Art has been expected to be half of a samurai’s pursuits since the founding of the Empire. An appreciation and understanding of art is so ingrained in a samurai’s training that to look upon a work and not be moved is, to the samurai, a sure sign of barbarianism, a charge that bestows great shame upon those who bear it. The more martial clans understand that art is essential for clearing a warrior’s mind and reminding them of life while so often surrounded by death.",
            "The Aesthetics skill covers activities that create non-utilitarian visual art, such as bonsai (trimming plants to encourage their growth in an artistic fashion), ikebana (flower arrangement), origami, painting, and rock gardening. Such arts serve a deeply important role in the courts of Rokugan, and any courtier is expected to have an understanding of their principles, techniques, and guiding philosophies. By understanding a work of art, one can gain insight into its creator, and that insight can be invaluable in pursuing political agendas and court intrigue alike."

Thus, while not all samurai explore the finer points of wordsmithing, literature is an elevated art in Rokugan. Courtly samurai are expected to know dozens of classic poems by heart and grasp literary allusions that can provide important subtext in conversation. The best poets compose in the moment, with every sentence they speak layered with meaning.",
            "Haiku, a three-line poem with five syllables in the first line, seven in the second, then five in the last, is one of the most popular forms of poetry in Rokugan. Writers often use it to describe a moment in time, from the first snowflake seen in winter to a moment of tranquility by a pond. Others practice different forms of poetry, including longer poems and competitions of linked poems traded back and forth, or write prose in the form of travel diaries, philosophical essays, and even fantastical tales.",
            "Literature allows a character to create powerful compositions that sway readers and to understand the literary devices and allusions that underlie such influential works. Additionally, the aesthetics of calligraphy are important to many writers in Rokugan, so Composition also governs the act of putting words on a surface in ink in a pleasing way."

A character versed in Theology is also versed in religious history and associated knowledge, including astronomy (for the study of portents) and the related fields of metaphysics and science with mystical implications.",

However, for most characters, Theology does not involve such flashy displays, dealing more in the doctrines and histories of the various spiritual traditions of Rokugan. It usually entails knowledge of rituals of philosophical and religious significance, as well as of communion with the forces of the universe on a more subtle level. Not everyone has the potential to become a shugenja—and perhaps more importantly, the shugenja schools guard their secrets jealously—so most priests in the Emerald Empire are humble keepers of the faith, serving the kami via proper veneration and performing social and religious functions for their communities. Monks, courtiers, and even bushi are also likely to study Theology, for a variety of personal and societal reasons."

            "Martial skills are defined by struggle, and for many warriors, the greatest struggle is the one within. Meditation is the skill that covers the battles fought in one’s own mind. It is the skill used to process one’s own emotions, to recover mental control when shocked, and to resist confusion and supernatural influence of the mind. War might be a samurai’s pursuit, but a human being at war must face the steady erosion of the soul or risk succumbing completely to brutality. Most samurai train in Meditation both to ready their minds for the terrors of battle and to seek greater cosmic knowledge within themselves."

While it may be true that every battle’s outcome is decided before the first soldier moves, it falls to battlefield leaders, from generals to squad sergeants, to make that outcome a reality. Tactics governs battlefield leadership, from the general’s tent to the front line. It reflects a character’s awareness of the flow of battle and their ability to both stick to their orders and seize the opportunities that arise to greatest effect. While the Command skill is used to motivate soldiers, restore morale, and maintain order, the Tactics skill is used to effectively manage troops who are already obedient. Whereas the Government skill handles logistics in the lead-up to battle, the Tactics skill governs a character’s ability to think and react once the battle is joined."
